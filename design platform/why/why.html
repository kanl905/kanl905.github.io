	<h1>mission statement</h1>

	<div class="text">
		<p>we believe capitalism works to exploit women of color, favors profit over their rights and well-being. <span>this devalues the labor of craft to uphold white supremacy and patriarchy.</span> fast fashion encourages overconsumption, harms the environment, and hurts independent designers and businesses. for <span>far too long capitalism has limited creativity and authenticity</span>; we are sick of it.</p>

		<p>our platform was designed to spread information about how <span>craft can serve as a tool to dismantle capitalism.</span> we hope to create a space that fosters community and growth, where design can flourish.</p>

		<p>our goal is to educate about the history of craftivism, uplift independent designers, provide accessible resources for craft, encourage users to make their own clothing, and propose alternatives to overconsumption.</p>

		<p><span>fashion under capitalism is inherently unsustainable</span>, we have formulated seven steps to help you be a mindful consumer. no consumer is perfect and making mistakes is inevitable. we ask viewers to be kind to themselves in their practice. do the best you can with the time and resources you have :)</p>

		<ol>
		<li>be aware of your consumption and avoid overconsumption
		use what you already have</li>
		<li>recycle and mend clothing (craft)</li>
		<li>make your own clothing</li>
		<li>organize clothing swaps to trade clothing with family and friends</li>
		<li>shop second hand</li>
		<li>shop local and from small businesses</li>
		<li>when you do need to buy new, try to research the ethics and sustainability practices of who you are buying from</li>
		</ol>

		<p>all of the text on our website is intentionally lowercase to pay tribute and honor the memory of bell hooks.</p>

		<p>while anyone regardless of identity can contribute to the craftivist movements, our platform is womanist and aims to highlight and uplift women of color and their labor in social justice work.</p>
