<h2>Is there such a thing as “Sustainable Fashion”?</h2>
<h3>The truth about ethical consumption</h3>
	<div class="text">
		<p>For the past few decades, there has been a growing concern on issues such as climate change, sweatshop labor, and environmental injustice, especially in the fashion industry. This resulted in a surge of sustainable, eco-friendly fashion brands and a growing focus on conscious consumerism. These sustainable fashion brands essentially provide products that are produced in ways that minimize social and environmental impacts, this usually includes the implementation of fair labor practices, having clean supply chains, reducing wastes, and other practices that are considered responsible, providing consumers an alternative to fast-fashion and its prominent harmful impacts.</p>                 
		<p>The problem is, fast fashion companies started exploiting this trend by advertising their products, aims, and policies as “sustainable” or “environmentally-friendly”, making them appear more sustainable than they are. This is known as Greenwashing, a term used to describe the widespread phenomena where brands or companies provide misleading information regarding their sustainable practices, allowing them to appeal to eco-conscious customers without having to make significant changes to their business practices. Greenwashing has become a way for these fast-fashion companies to profit off of consumer guilt and climate anxiety, and unfortunately, a majority of consumers have fallen for this marketing ploy. </p>

		<p>However, despite how much people advocate for ethical consumption and pressure others to stop buying into fast fashion to reduce environmental damage and social impacts, we as consumers will not be able to solve the problem as a whole. This is because large corporations, wealthy individuals, and other capitalists are truly the ones responsible for polluting and damaging the planet in the first place, not individual consumers. It doesn’t matter how much people start turning into more ethical or sustainable options, as this could hardly counter the damage that has been created by major corporations. </p>

		<p>The reality is, ethical consumption does not exist under capitalism. The whole idea of ethical consumption is just another way to hide the inherently exploitative nature of the profit motive, and divert the blame towards individual consumers instead of the corporations who are responsible. It’s simply an illusion that leads us into believing that there is a more ethical option under capitalism that could be achieved by spending more on “sustainable” products or purchasing from “ethical” businesses when in reality, the system itself will never be ethical. As a system based around the production for-profit and private ownership of the means of production—exploitation, oppression, and environmental destruction will always be inherent to capitalism. </p>   
		<p>However, this does not mean that we could use this concept as an excuse to contribute to exploitative industries. We understand that fast fashion is an affordable and accessible option to most people, but we also need to recognize the major environmental and social impacts caused by the fast-fashion industry... Choosing to buy from sustainable brands is expensive and inaccessible to most people, and the popularity of thrifting has led to an increase in prices on second-hand products, not to mention the issue of size inclusivity that most people face when it comes to thrifting clothes. </p>

		<p>So what can we do?</p>

		<p>We need to acknowledge the fact that obtaining clothes from either one of the options mentioned above still contributes to a larger problem in our society: overconsumption and the overflowing of landfills. That is why we think making our own clothing pieces or repurposing the garments we already have is a great ethical and sustainable fashion option. Making our own pieces allows us to not only spend less and customize our clothing, but also value our clothing pieces much more. This could eventually prolong the life cycles of our clothing and reduce the amount of garment wastes that would end up in landfills.</p>
