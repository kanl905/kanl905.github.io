    <h1>An Interview with Viviann Nguyen</h1>
        <h2>conducted by Jasmine Kan</h2>
    <div class="one">
        <div class="jasmine"> Jasmine</div>
         <div class="question">So you told me that you have narcolepsy. Would you mind telling me about how you got diagnosed and your journey with that?</div>
        <div class="viviann"> Viviann</div>
         <div class="answer">I first found out I had narcolepsy when I was in 4th grade. In the beginning of 4th grade during class I always fell asleep during lessons or when the teacher was reading. I never knew why I was always tired and always falling asleep. I would get yelled at by my teacher all the time. It was happening too constantly that I told my doctor. I was suggested by my doctor to get a sleep study. After getting a sleep study I was diagnosed with narcolepsy. Ever since then I have been trying to live a normal life with a sleeping disorder.</div>

        <div class="jasmine"> Jasmine</div>
         <div class="question">How would you define narcolepsy? </div>
        <div class="viviann"> Viviann</div>
         <div class="answer">I would define narcolepsy as daytime sleepiness. I can fall asleep literally anywhere anytime. If I sit still without movement for too long I can fall asleep easily.</div>
     </div>
<br>
     <div class="three">
        <div class="jasmine"> Jasmine</div>
         <div class="question">Have you adapted your routine to accommodate your condition? If so, how?</div>
        <div class="viviann"> Viviann</div>
         <div class="answer">I’ve accommodated my narcolepsy in many different ways. One is I take daily medication to help me stay awake. I have also incorporated naps into my routine. If I don't take my naps then I get tired easily and can get sick and have migraines. I also do things in short periods of time with rests and breaks in between. I cannot work for long periods of time or I will become tired.</div>
     </div>
<br>
     <div class="four">
        <div class="jasmine"> Jasmine</div>
         <div class="question">How has living with a chronic disorder affected your mindset?</div>
        <div class="viviann"> Viviann</div>
         <div class="answer">It hasn’t affected my mindset too much as I have always been a positive person. I try to live my life as if I don't have this neurological disorder. I try to work my hardest and do my best no matter what. In a way it has helped me think differently. If it wasn;t for it I wouldn’t be who I am today.</div>
     </div>
<br>
     <div class="five">
        <div class="jasmine"> Jasmine</div>
         <div class="question">Has narcolepsy affected your relationships? (any, friendships, family, teacher etc)</div>
        <div class="viviann"> Viviann</div>
         <div class="answer">I would say it hasn’t affected my relationships too much. My family and I have always been close and my narcolepsy doesn’t affect that. As for my friends I have always had great friends that are understanding of my condition and dont judge me for it. The only con is that I can get tired easily when I hang out with them for too long but they know this and let me sleep if I need to. In school I was lucky enough to have teachers that were always accepting of it and understood if I needed extra time on test or quizzes or were ok if I dozed off in class.</div>
     </div>
<br>
     <div class="six">
        <div class="jasmine"> Jasmine</div>
         <div class="question">Is there a way people around you can make your life a little easier?</div>
        <div class="viviann"> Viviann</div>
         <div class="answer">I just ask that people are understanding and respectful and don’t make judgments about me because of my disorder. I want people to know I am a hard working person even if I may seem like I’m lazy or don't do much. I always want people to understand that I get tired easily and need breaks often.</div>
     </div>
<br>
     <div class="seven">
        <div class="jasmine"> Jasmine</div>
         <div class="question">Have you met anyone else with narcolepsy?</div>
        <div class="viviann"> Viviann</div>
         <div class="answer">I personally haven't met anyone with narcolepsy but I do know Jimmy Kimmel and Kang Daniel (a kpop idol) have narcolepsy.</div>
     </div>
<br>
     <div class="eight">
        <div class="jasmine"> Jasmine</div>
         <div class="question">What’s the biggest misconception people around you have about narcolepsy?</div>
        <div class="viviann"> Viviann</div>
         <div class="answer">The biggest misconception people have about me is that I’m lazy and don’t work hard. I always try my best even if I’m tired. I try to push through and try to get things done.</div>
     </div>
<br>
     <div class="nine">
        <div class="jasmine"> Jasmine</div>
         <div class="question">How are you feeling about your move from Boston to New York in regards to your disorder and medical care?</div>
        <div class="viviann"> Viviann</div>
         <div class="answer">I feel fine especially because I’m still in the same time zone so I didn't need to adjust my sleep schedule. I'm still trying to get used to my new schedule though as my zoom class schedule is different from my in person class schedule. I still keep in touch with my doctor which I don't have to meet with often and I still have my medication I take daily.</div>
     </div>
<br>
     <div class="ten">
        <div class="jasmine"> Jasmine</div>
         <div class="question">What’s one thing you want people to take away from this interview?</div>
        <div class="viviann"> Viviann</div>
         <div class="answer">Yes I have narcolepsy and I may get tired really easily but that doesnt mean Im not a hard worker or I don't like to hang out with my friends. I am still a person and would like to be treated the same. </div>
